Project folder for advanced python programming course

Instead of using Google Drive, we now will be using Github to keep track of the current state of our project folder. 
You can see what we've been working on without downloading anything by looking through this repository.

## Install
Here are the basic steps to download our project to your computer.

A line like `$ cd src` means you should type `cd src` into your terminal/command prompt.

1. If you don't have Git installed, I suggest 
[gitforwindows](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.29.0.windows.1/Git-2.29.0-64-bit.exe). 
This will allow you to use "git" from your terminal/command prompt.
2. `$ git clone https://github.com/Starchery/cit-advanced-python.git`
3. `$ cd cit-advanced-python`
4. (Optional, but good habit) Create and activate a virtual environment
5. `$ pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. (Optional) Check that everything is working by running `$ pytest -v`. This should run our [tests](tests/) and show the output. If anything goes wrong here, [let me know.](mailto:randolph.henry.work@gmail.com)
7. (Optional) Read the notes we've taken so far. They're in the [docs](docs/) folder.
