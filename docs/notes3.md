### Init

Tells "git" to keep track of the changes you make
to files that you add to the repository


### Add

Adding a file allows us to keep track of changes made to it


### Commit

Make the changes you've made to files part of the
project history

You're "ahead" of the project after you commit.


### Push

Update the repository to reflect the changes
you made in your commits


### Pull

If you're on an outdated version of the repository,
you can "pull" from another, more recent version
to see any new changes
